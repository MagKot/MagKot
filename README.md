## [Generic Shop Testing Project](https://github.com/MagKot/Generic-Shop-Testing)

I've decided to make a project that included test plan, test cases and test report of [Generic Shop](http://skleptest.pl/) e-commerce website

For Test Plan, Test Cases and Bug Report I was using TestLink, Bugs were reported in Jira. Everything is in polish for now.
